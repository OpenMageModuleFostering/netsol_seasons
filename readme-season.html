            <h2 id="description">Description</h2>
            <p><strong>Version 1.0.0</strong></p>

			<p>The present day eCommerce customers are highly accustomed to features like product recommendations and personalization.
			 A website that hosts features that help them save their browsing efforts and time are the most desirable.<br/>
			While most of the retailers are leveraging big data to enhance the precision in personalized recommendations, it is time they classify the recommendations on the basis of the product category and apply all the intelligence in understanding the customer's consumption cycles.</p>
			<p>Personalytics is one such Magento plugin/extension that not only entails order history, but also considers local season or weather (at customer's location) and the shelf-life of the product while framing the recommendations. This Extension also includes the feature of email Segmentation.</p>
